Guide how to use SnowiQ App

# Driver App 1
** Both the Android and iOS applications have the same functionality and the screenshots below are a combination of both.**

# Login 2
The login screen below allows Driver users to enter the SnowIQ Driver Application (DA). Click the appropriate 'Login' button to be re-routed to enter the assigned User Name and Password for the application

Once logged into the DA, Drivers will see the screen below. The screens display two types of drivers logged in, a County Driver and a Contractor. The difference is identified in the status of the Driver. The County Driver, on the left, has a status of 'Ready' whereas the Contractor, on the right, is in 'Standby.' The circle next to the profile picture indicates that this a County Driver and a square is a Contractor. These icons are color coded to match the status.
