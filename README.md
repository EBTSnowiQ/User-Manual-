Once logged into the DA, Drivers will see the screen below. The screens display two types of drivers logged in, a County Driver and a Contractor. The difference is identified in the status of the Driver. The County Driver, on the left, has a status of 'Ready' whereas the Contractor, on the right, is in 'Standby.' The circle next to the profile picture indicates that this a County Driver and a square is a Contractor. These icons are color coded to match the status.
